				<h1>Pubsub</h1>

				<p>This is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern" target="_blank">publish-subscribe pattern</a> for JavaScript and NodeJS.</p>

				<p>By publishing and subscribing to events instead of tightly coupling interaction between components, they can work together and in isolation, without needing to know about one another's existence.</p>

					<h2>Subscribe</h2>

					<code>subscribe(event, callback)</code>

					<p>Subscribe to <code>event</code>, calling the <code>callback</code> event every time the specified event is published.</p>

					<p>Similar to the behaviour of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener" target="_blank">addEventListener</a>, attempting to subscribe a function to the same event more than once will have no effect.</p>

					<h3>Arguments</h3>

					<h4>event</h4>

					<p>The name of the event to be subscribed to, as a string.</p>

					<h4>callback</h4>

					<p>A function to call when the specified event is published.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Publish</h2>

					<code>publish(event, ...args)</code>

					<p>Publish the specified event, and pass any number of arguments to each function subscribed to that event.</p>

					<p>If multiple events are subscribed to an event, they are called in the order in which they were subscribed.</p>

					<h3>Arguments</h3>

					<h4>event</h4>

					<p>The name of the event to be published.</p>

					<h4>args</h4>

					<p>Any number of arguments to be used when calling functions that are subscribed to the published event.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Unsubscribe</h2>

					<code>unsubscribe(event, callback)</code>

					<p>Unsubscribe the <code>callback</code> function from the specified <code>event</code>, so it is no longer called when the event is published.</p>

					<p>If a function is not subscribed to an event, attempting to unsubscribe it will have no effect.</p>

					<h3>Arguments</h3>

					<h4>event</h4>

					<p>The name of the event to be unsubscribed from, as a string.</p>

					<h4>callback</h4>

					<p>A function that was subscribed to the specified event.</p>
				</section>

				<h3>Examples</h3>

				<button type="button" class="js-example-subscribe">Subscribe</button>

				<button type="button" class="js-example-publish">Publish</button>

				<button type="button" class="js-example-unsubscribe">Unsubscribe</button>

				<p>Times callback called: <span id="example-output">0</span></p>
